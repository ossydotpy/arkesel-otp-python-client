# arkesel-otp-python-client
Client for Arkesel OTP API.

When using arkesel, annoyingly you have to have two balances:
- one for sms
- one for the otp account

This is a wrapper around the [Arkesel SMS API](https://developers.arkesel.com/#tag/SMS-V2) to use your sms balance to send OTP codes instead of maintaining two balances.
